# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform and Ansible

## Overview

This project automates the provisioning of two environments (development and production) in AWS using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management.

The goal is to streamline the setup process for AWS infrastructure by leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. This approach ensures consistent environments across different stages of development, simplifies deployment, and enhances scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Infrastructure Provisioning**
- **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Separation**
- **Cost Efficiency**

Happy coding!
